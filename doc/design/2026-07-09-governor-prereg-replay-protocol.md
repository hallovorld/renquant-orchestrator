# D6: Preregistered replay protocol — Deployment Governor evaluation

STATUS: preregistration (companion to the Deployment Governor RFC, same PR)
DATE: 2026-07-09
DISCIPLINE: every rule, arm, estimand, and tolerance below is FROZEN at protocol
sign-off (PR merge), BEFORE any evaluation arm is run or inspected. Changes after
sign-off void the run and require a new protocol version.

## 1. Data and session freeze rule

- **Source**: the WF-cut loader used by `run_ab_replay.py` (renquant-pipeline
  `portfolio_qp/`), which refuses synthetic placeholder bars by construction.
- **Freeze rule** (mechanical, no discretion): all WF manifold cuts available at
  sign-off, EXCLUDING any session in the hypothesis-generation window
  **2026-06-23 → 2026-07-09** and excluding any session individually inspected in
  the evidence memo (#442). The concrete cut list (exact session IDs), manifest SHA,
  data cutoff date, and as-of feature/model artifact timestamps are committed in the
  S0 results PR header BEFORE arms run.
- **Nested selection** (r1 point 3): ALL Governor hyperparameters — regime `E_ceil`
  values, hysteresis band width, top-k, shrinkage `s`, Kelly fraction `λ` — are
  chosen on a TUNING subset of sessions disjoint from the evaluation subset. Both
  subset ID lists are frozen in the same commit. The evaluation subset is never used
  to choose any parameter; a parameter change after seeing evaluation results
  requires a new protocol version and a fresh evaluation subset.
- **Live confirmation set**: S1 shadow sessions are future-only by construction.

## 1.1 Cost, tax, and fill conventions (frozen)

- Linear transaction cost: 5 bps per side on every traded dollar, both directions.
- Tax drag: realized-gain tax at configured rates (short 50% / long 32%) charged on
  every exit leg's realized PnL, via the existing `tax_drag()` convention.
- Whole-share quantization applied in all arms' execution layer (no fractional
  assumption anywhere in the replay).
- Fill convention: full fill at the session close price (replay convention; the
  S1 live shadow measures real-world deviation from this assumption).

## 1.2 Statistical contract (frozen)

- Paired daily returns per arm-pair; inference on the paired series with
  HAC/Newey-West standard errors (forward-return overlap at the 60d horizon makes
  iid inference invalid).
- Promotion bar per comparison: paired mean advantage point estimate ≥ +1 bp/day
  AND HAC 95% CI excluding 0 AND DSR ≥ 0.95 AND PBO ≤ 0.10 (the harness's existing
  significance pass).
- Marginal-capital estimand: same bar (CI excluding 0) on the paired difference
  series defined in §3.
- "Governor ≥ baseline" without meeting this bar is NOT enable-grade evidence.

## 2. Arms

**Phase 1 (runs immediately — no new code required):** the registered baseline
allocators: `equal_weight_top_k`, `inverse_vol_top_k`, `fractional_kelly_top_k`,
`hybrid_option_f_allocator`, `hard_only_qp_allocator`, `current_qp` (reference),
`stage_a_a2_long_only`.
Purpose: establish the naive-diversification floor ordering (DeMiguel 2009) and
confirm/refute the prior clean-signal finding that α-tilt dominates current_qp.

**Phase 2 (after D2 lands + this protocol is finalized; treatment family LOCKED
here per the #447 review, before any evaluation run):**
- **L1 candidate**: regime-ceiling-riding E* (fail-closed + hysteresis retained);
  `governor_kelly` (Σ shrunk-Kelly E*) and `voltarget` (σ_target/σ̂_pf) demoted
  to comparison arms — the #447 tuning result showed both are second-order to
  the breadth×cap ceiling, but that finding is exploratory and all three run in
  the confirmatory evaluation.
- **Breadth×cap grid (amended after the cap-grid exploratory run,
  doc/research/evidence/cap_grid_tuning/)**: per-name cap {12%, 20%} × weights
  {equal_weight, capped-Kelly}, deployment = regime-ceiling. Cap 25% is DROPPED
  from the confirmatory family: on the tuning subset it bought +18pp deployment
  at −8.2% net return (vs +4.7% at cap 12), doubled the single-name loss tail
  (p5 −0.97% → −1.98% of PV), and deepened MDD — dominated on every axis except
  raw deployment; carrying it into eval would spend a multiplicity budget on a
  dominated arm.
- **Veto-floor arms MOVE to a shadow A/B protocol** (design flaw in the r3 grid,
  found by the same run): replay bars contain only post-admission survivors
  (median breadth 4) — pre-veto candidates are not in the sim DB, so a veto
  {1.0σ, 0.5σ} arm CANNOT be replayed with existing data. Admission-breadth
  treatments run in the live SHADOW pipeline (which executes the full funnel
  incl. veto) under their own preregistered protocol: shadow config veto at
  0.5σ vs prod 1.0σ, end-of-chain deployed fraction + forward-return ledger
  comparison, same non-degradation gates. Breadth is the PRIMARY remaining
  lever per the identity `deployable ≤ breadth × cap` and the cap result above.
- **Fractional-shares dependency quantified**: integer flooring shaves 3.1-4.1pp
  of deployment at $10.7k PV in every arm; P(E_exec ≥ 0.90) is stuck at 10-12%
  regardless of cap — reaching ~90% living deployment requires breadth ≥ 5-8
  PLUS fractional execution (S-FRAC v2 stage-3) or larger PV. Cross-references
  the D7 memo (#444).
- **Controls**: cash/parking-sleeve arm (idle capital at T-bill yield).
- **Evaluation scheme**: rolling CONTIGUOUS train/evaluation folds (predeclared;
  kills the off-universe churn × tax artifact that dominated the exploratory
  tuning run).
- **Additional gates**: concentration-event gate (per-session max single-name
  loss contribution) and turnover-tax gate (total tax+cost as a fraction of
  gross return), tolerances frozen at protocol sign-off.
- Any cap value above 12% reaching ENABLE additionally requires recorded
  operator sign-off (capital-risk change), after this confirmatory evidence.

## 3. Estimands

**Primary:**
1. End-of-chain deployed fraction (mean and per-session distribution).
2. Paired daily portfolio returns vs each baseline arm, significance via the
   existing DSR / PBO pass (`compute_significance_verdicts`) — promotion-grade
   requires positive paired mean with DSR ≥ 0.95 and PBO ≤ 0.10 (the harness's
   existing promotion bar).

**Decomposed design (r2 point 2 accepted — the L1 deployment question and the L2
allocator question are separate, answered by separate paired comparisons):**

- **(a) L1 — does Governor-selected E* beat incumbent deployment?** SAME allocator
  on both sides, and that allocator is PREREGISTERED HERE as `equal_weight_top_k`
  (r3 review accepted — choosing (b)'s winner on the evaluation subset would make
  (a) post-selection; equal-weight is fixed a priori as the DeMiguel-floor
  default, independent of any evaluation outcome):
  `equal_weight@E*_governor` vs `equal_weight@E*_incumbent`, where incumbent E*
  is the session's realized live deployment from run bundles.
- **(b) L2 — which allocator, at MATCHED exposure?** All allocator variants run at
  the SAME session E*; allocator skill judged independent of deployment level.
- **(c) Combined system vs incumbent**: `governor + chosen allocator` end-to-end vs
  incumbent greedy+Kelly+multipliers. The enable decision references (c), with
  (a)/(b) as its decomposition — if (c) wins but (a) is flat, the win is
  allocator-only and the Governor layer must not claim it, and vice versa.

**Quality of marginal capital** (Codex requirement from #442): the EXTRA exposure
in (a) must itself earn ≥ 0 net forward return — computed as the paired return
difference between (a)'s two registered arms. This is exactly reproducible (same
allocator, same sessions, only E* differs); no separately-constructed synthetic
portfolio exists. More invested but worse risk-adjusted = REJECT.

**Risk-normalization rule**: raising deployment mechanically raises portfolio
volatility; that risk appetite is the operator's granted mandate, NOT an estimand.
(b) isolates allocator skill at matched E*; (a) isolates the deployment decision;
the §4 gates bound the risk of both.

## 4. Non-degradation gates (tolerances frozen now)

| Gate | Tolerance | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Max single-name weight | ≤ 12% | existing operator sizing mandate |
| Max sector weight | ≤ 35% | existing regime cap |
| Session turnover | ≤ 2× the equal-weight arm's | churn control without a shared L1 cap |
| Max drawdown (replay window) | ≤ regime `drawdown_halt_pct` (0.35) with ≥ 5pp headroom (i.e. ≤ 0.30) | never design to the halt line |
| Fail-closed behavior | Governor emits no target on stale/mismatched model in 100% of injected-failure cases | RFC §2.1 semantics |

## 5. Decision rules

ENABLE the Governor (proceed S1 → S2) iff ALL of:
- Governor arm beats `equal_weight_top_k` and `inverse_vol_top_k` on paired returns
  at the DSR/PBO bar (if it cannot beat naive diversification, ship equal-weight
  under the same E* governor — the L1 layer can still be right when the L2 answer
  is "naive");
- marginal-capital estimand ≥ 0;
- every gate in §4 passes;
- no single session violates the concentration caps.

REJECT / REDESIGN iff any gate breaches, or the marginal-capital estimand is
negative (deploying more of this signal destroys value — then the cash-drag answer
is "the signal doesn't support more deployment", and the honest next move is the
parking sleeve (RS-1) for idle cash, not forced equity exposure).

**Stop rule** (r2 point 2 accepted — split by venue):
- **Historical replay**: NO mid-window abort — aborting an arm on a
  drawdown/turnover breach censors returns asymmetrically. Every arm runs the FULL
  registered horizon; a gate breach is RECORDED and fails promotion, but the
  series completes.
- **Live shadow / canary (S1/S2)**: immediate stop on any gate breach — safety
  dominates statistical cleanliness once real or near-real capital is involved.

## 6. What this protocol does NOT authorize

- No live enablement: S2 canary and S3 enable each require their own recorded
  decision (S3 = behavior change → pre-registration gate + operator notification).
- No long-short: L4 has its own future protocol.
- No fractional shares: D7 memo → operator decision, independent of this.
