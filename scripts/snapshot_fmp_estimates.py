"""Forward snapshotter for FMP analyst estimates / consensus / targets.

WHY (2026-06-27): the analyst estimate-*revision* signal is the literature's
best large-cap orthogonal lead (post-revision drift; Womack 1996, Gleason-Lee
2003 -- see ``doc/design/2026-06-24-analyst-revision-feature.md``). It is
currently **un-buildable** because our FMP harvest
(``data/fmp_harvest/`` in the umbrella, umbrella PR #409) is a single *current*
snapshot with **no revision history**: every parquet there reflects the
consensus as it was on the harvest day only. A point-in-time audit confirmed we
cannot reconstruct "what the consensus was 1m/3m ago" from a one-shot snapshot.

The fix is cheap and only needs *time*: start snapshotting the estimates
**forward from today** so a real as-of revision history accrues. Run this once a
day; after ~3-6 months you have a dated series and can compute trailing
Δ(consensus estimate) as-of each date with no look-ahead.

This script ONLY fetches and writes dated snapshots to a NEW dedicated path
(default ``data/estimate_snapshots/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<endpoint>.parquet``). It never
writes a canonical/existing data path and never schedules itself -- wiring a
cron/launchd job is a separate operator deploy decision.

Auth/endpoint pattern matches the existing harvest (the FMP ``stable`` API,
``apikey`` query param, key read read-only from the umbrella ``.env``).

PIT PROVENANCE (HARD INVARIANT): every row is fetched NOW. ``snapshot_as_of`` is
therefore ALWAYS the actual UTC fetch date, and each manifest also records the
``fetched_at`` UTC timestamp. ``--as-of`` is accepted ONLY when it equals today's
UTC date (a redundant, self-documenting assertion that also fails loudly on host
clock drift); BOTH a PAST and a FUTURE ``--as-of`` are REJECTED. A past date
would fabricate point-in-time history that never existed; a future date would
stamp today's freshly fetched data as future data -- equally fake provenance.
Scheduling picks the date directory at RUN TIME from the real fetch date; it does
NOT pre-name a future slot. Historical backfill is valid *only* from an immutable
source that was actually captured at that historical time (with its own
provenance) -- this forward collector cannot and must not manufacture it.

ATOMIC PUBLISH: each date is written to a sibling temp dir, validated against a
coverage floor, and published with an atomic rename ONLY on success. A
partial/error fetch is marked ``status: partial`` and is NOT published over an
existing good snapshot. By default an existing successful snapshot is a no-op
(verify), never a destructive refetch -- pass ``--force`` to deliberately
re-publish.

Usage:
    # demo to /tmp (proves fetch+write without touching live data/)
    python scripts/snapshot_fmp_estimates.py --out /tmp/snap_demo

    # explicit universe file (one ticker per line, or a strategy_config.json)
    python scripts/snapshot_fmp_estimates.py --universe /path/to/universe.txt

    # assert today's date explicitly (must EQUAL today's UTC date; past/future error)
    python scripts/snapshot_fmp_estimates.py --as-of 2026-06-27

    # see what would be fetched/written without any network call or write
    python scripts/snapshot_fmp_estimates.py --dry-run

Cron-safety: re-running an already-published date is a no-op verify (NOT a
destructive refetch). For a real scheduled deploy, wrap the invocation in a
``flock`` guard so two runs can't race the same date dir, e.g.::

    flock -n /tmp/snapshot_fmp_estimates.lock \
        python scripts/snapshot_fmp_estimates.py --out data/estimate_snapshots

Scheduling itself is intentionally NOT done here.
